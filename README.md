# Jan's Online Portfolio

Project to highlight and make my portfolio accessible to others. 

## Inspiration

I was inspired to make my own portfolio website after seeing other exceptional portfoilio examples on the internet. 
Wanting to take a shot at this, I decided to craft my own. 

## Features

The portfolio takes use of CSS media queries to ensure the content is readable at different screen sizes including pc, tablets and mobile. 
It also features a simple theme switch button that swaps from the default dark theme to a brighter version by using Javascript. 

Otherwise the website is only using HTML + CSS.
